# OpinnoTest

This project was created in Angular 4. The aplication receives information from the api http://swapi.co/

It is deployed in github pages. you can find it here --> https://mglprzlrnz.github.io/opinnoTest/ 

As requested, I have created a single application web with the following features:

In the main page you can find a Search component where you can find the Star Wars movies by title. If you write part of a title of any of the movies it will pop up under the search input. (by clicking search with the input "blanck", you will get all Star Wars movies)

On the results, you can click on any of the titles if you wish to get more info about this particular movie.

The second component on the main page is a character carousel. By clicking "next"/"previous" you will move through all movies characters. (please note after 10 characters the app will make a new call so it might be a bit slow).  


On the top left there is a button to direct you to the Browser history. This browser is stored in the LocalStorage.
